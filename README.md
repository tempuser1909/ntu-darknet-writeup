# ntu-darknet-writeup

The DARKNET environment is a custom-made network for students who are keen on taking a step further in honing their Penetration Testing skills. The various servers hosted in this environment are customised, and are bound to test the limits of all the brave participants. Only those who have tried harder will survive.

All the boxes are managed and designed by NTU alumni students who are currently active in the Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) field in the workforce.
